# eclipse-git-test
Testing how to integration egit,git and eclipse/myeclipse

Need to confirm how the following scenarios work.
1.  Clone an existing repository that is on github to a local repository and then work with a project in eclipse.
* Making a change after opening the project in Eclipse in the Project Explorer view.  Save and then push changes to github.
